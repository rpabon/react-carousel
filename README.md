# React Carousel

Carousel with slides indicator. Supports HTML and images. It has two modes; the default provides a full width slide and
`multi` mode shifts to the left only the width of the current slide.

When the last slide is reached the next one is the first, making it a full circle.

In `src/App.tsx` there are three use examples.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Runs tests

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
